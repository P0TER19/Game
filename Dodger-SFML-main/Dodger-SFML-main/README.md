# Dodger-SFML
Simple game made in C++ with SFML

I was kinda bored so I decided to make something simple.

I feel like it could be better, but I didnt want to spend more time working on this.

There could be something like saving your top score in a file but as I already said I didnt want to spend more time on this.
So top score will always be 0 after running game

Game can be ran from Debug or Release
